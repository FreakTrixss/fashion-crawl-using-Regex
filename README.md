this is a sample code for crawling a fashion website.
in this code we are using the BeautifulSoup and Regex for finding the perfect data that we want.
and the request library for getting the request we want from the links we have gathered.

tha data is not fully checked there could be some problems in the patterns and
the patterns may not be 100% true.
but they are working throw the data's we have checked by now.
